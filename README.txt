Fed up with the lack of automated tools to properly crop and scale post thumbnails? Maybe this plugin can help.

== Description ==

To meet the needs of themes where the post-thumbnails have random and capricious sizes (which causes wordpress to crop images simply from the middle (either chopping off the top and bottom or chopping off the sides), this plugin attempts to give the users an interface to manually fix those thumbnail and random images.

**Use**:

1. Open Media Library
2. Pick the image to edit
3. Click "Edit Image"
4. Use the dropdown box underneath the "Thumbnail Settings" section to select the thumbnail that you want to edit.
5. After you select the cropped/scaled area, click "Save"
6. You might have to refresh the cache (ctrl+f5 on the page) to see changes, but they should be there.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Rock On

= or =
1. Install from within your wordpress admin area by searching for "post thumbnail editor"
