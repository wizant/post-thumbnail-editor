Fancy Box Jquery Plugin
=======================

I just wanted to have a git repository for the [fancybox jQuery plugin](http://fancybox.net/) so that I could use it for my submodules. Originally this was just to recreate exactly the structure of the zip file you could download from the official site. So the official zip structure can be found in the example branch while the master is a cut of the fancybox directory with an additional closure compiled/minified version of the fancybox plugin.
